# Study Time Calculator

# Input study times for each subject
math_time = float(input("Enter hours needed for Math: "))
reading_time = float(input("Enter hours needed for Reading: "))
cs_time = float(input("Enter hours needed for Computer Science: "))

# Calculate total time
total_time = math_time + reading_time + cs_time

# Output the results
print("\nStudy Time Breakdown:")
print(f"Math: {math_time} hours")
print(f"Reading: {reading_time} hours")
print(f"Computer Science: {cs_time} hours")

# Output total time to complete all study chores
print(f"\nTotal study time needed: {total_time} hours")

# Optional: estimate time per day if you want to finish in X days
days = int(input("\nEnter number of days to finish studying: "))
time_per_day = total_time / days
print(f"You need to study {time_per_day:.2f} hours per day.")
